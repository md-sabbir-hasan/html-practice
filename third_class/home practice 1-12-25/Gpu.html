    <h1>About GPU</h1>
    <p>
      A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit
      designed to accelerate graphics and image processing by performing
      parallel calculations, originally for rendering images and video. GPUs are
      also used for a wide range of demanding tasks like gaming, scientific
      computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence because of their
      ability to process many pieces of data simultaneously. They can be found
      on dedicated graphics cards or integrated directly into a computer's CPU.
